**Wine Quality Prediction with Random Forest Classifier and Streamlit Cloud**

This project implements a machine learning model based on the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to predict the quality of wine. The model is deployed using Streamlit Cloud, providing an interactive web application for users to input wine attributes and receive quality predictions in real-time. Explore the codebase to understand the machine learning pipeline and deployment process.

**Key Features:**
- Random Forest model trained on wine attributes to predict quality.
- Streamlit web application for intuitive user interaction.
- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for seamless accessibility.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Streamlit Cloud

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for training the model consists of various attributes of wine samples along with quality ratings.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit application locally using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Access the deployed application on Streamlit Cloud.
